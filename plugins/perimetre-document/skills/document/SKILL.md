# Professional Document Writing

Clear, structured principles for writing documents that communicate well — whether for clients, leadership, or the broader team.

## Core Principles

### 1. Lead with the Conclusion

Start with what matters most. Readers should not have to read to the end to understand your main point.

- Open with an executive summary (1–3 sentences or a short bulleted list)
- State the recommendation, finding, or decision upfront
- Use the body to explain, justify, and detail

### 2. One Idea per Section

Each section has a single focus. If a section covers two unrelated topics, split it.

- Headings describe the section's content, not just label it
  - ❌ "Background"
  - ✅ "Why We're Changing the Design System"
- Keep sections short enough to read without scrolling on a standard screen

### 3. Write for Skimming

Assume your reader is busy. Structure the document so someone can get 80% of the value in 30 seconds.

- Use headings at every major break
- Bold the key term or takeaway in each paragraph
- Put the most important sentence first in each paragraph
- Use bullet points for lists of 3 or more items

### 4. Be Specific

Vague writing signals unclear thinking. Replace abstractions with specifics.

| ❌ Vague | ✅ Specific |
|----------|-------------|
| "We improved performance significantly." | "Page load time dropped from 4.2s to 1.8s." |
| "The project is progressing well." | "Phase 1 (design) is complete; Phase 2 (dev) starts Monday." |
| "There are several risks." | "Three risks: budget overrun, timeline slip, and scope creep." |
| "This will take some time." | "Estimated 3 weeks." |

## Document Structure

### Standard Structure

```
1. Title + Date + Author(s)
2. Executive Summary (3–5 sentences max)
3. [Body sections — varies by document type]
4. Recommendations / Next Steps
5. Appendix (if needed — for supporting data, not main content)
```

### Section Types

**For proposals:**
1. Problem / Opportunity
2. Proposed Approach
3. Scope & Deliverables
4. Timeline
5. Investment
6. Next Steps

**For status reports:**
1. Summary (what happened this period)
2. Completed this period
3. In progress
4. Blocked / Risks
5. Next period plan

**For technical specs:**
1. Overview
2. Context / Background
3. Requirements
4. Approach / Solution
5. Risks & Trade-offs
6. Open Questions

## Headings

Use headings to create a navigable structure. Follow a consistent hierarchy.

```
# Document Title        (H1 — once, at the top)
## Major Section        (H2 — main topics)
### Sub-section         (H3 — supporting detail)
#### Minor detail       (H4 — use sparingly)
```

**Rules:**
- Every H2 should stand on its own — a reader jumping to it should not be lost
- Avoid H4 and deeper if possible — restructure instead
- Headings are sentence case: "Why we chose this approach" not "Why We Chose This Approach" (unless title case is a brand standard)
- Never skip levels (H2 → H4)

---

## Lists

Use lists for parallel items. Don't use lists for flowing prose.

**When to use a bulleted list:**
- 3 or more items that don't have a natural order
- Items that are structurally parallel (all nouns, all actions, etc.)

**When to use a numbered list:**
- Steps in a process where order matters
- Ranked items

**Rules:**
- Keep list items parallel in structure
- End list items consistently — either all with periods or none
- Don't nest more than 2 levels deep
- If a list item needs a sub-paragraph, it should probably be its own section

---

## Tables

Use tables to compare options or display structured data.

**Good uses for tables:**
- Comparing features across options
- Displaying data with multiple attributes
- Before/after comparisons

**Structure:**
- Column headers are bold or capitalized
- Each cell contains one piece of information
- Align numbers to the right
- Keep tables narrow enough to read without horizontal scrolling

**Example:**

| Phase | Deliverable | Owner | Due |
|-------|-------------|-------|-----|
| Discovery | Research report | Design | Mar 3 |
| Design | Wireframes + prototype | Design | Mar 17 |
| Development | Production build | Dev | Apr 14 |

## Tone

Write like a knowledgeable colleague — not a lawyer, not a cheerleader.

**Do:**
- Use active voice: "We recommend" not "It is recommended"
- Be direct: "This won't work because..." not "There may be some challenges with..."
- Use "we" and "you" to be conversational
- Address the reader's likely questions before they ask them

**Don't:**
- Use jargon without defining it on first use
- Use filler phrases: "In order to", "It should be noted that", "At this point in time"
- Hedge every statement: "It seems like it might possibly be worth considering..."
- Use buzzwords without substance: "synergies", "leverage" (as a verb), "circle back"

---

## Callouts

Use callouts to draw attention to important notes, warnings, or tips.

**Note:** Background or context the reader should know.

**Important:** Something that affects the reader's decision or action.

**Warning:** A risk, a common mistake, or a hard constraint.

**Tip:** A shortcut or helpful suggestion.

Use callouts sparingly — if everything is highlighted, nothing is.

## Data Presentation

When presenting numbers and data:

- Always provide context: "1,200 visitors" → "1,200 visitors (+34% vs last month)"
- Round to meaningful precision: "42.857%" → "43%"
- Use consistent units throughout a document
- Prefer tables or inline text for simple data; reserve charts for trends or comparisons that benefit from visual scanning
- Cite your data source

## Before You Send

Run through this checklist:

- [ ] Does the executive summary stand alone? Could a busy reader understand the key point in 30 seconds?
- [ ] Is every heading descriptive, not just a label?
- [ ] Are there any vague statements that should be made specific?
- [ ] Is the recommendation or next step clearly stated?
- [ ] Is the document free of unnecessary jargon?
- [ ] Are lists parallel and consistent?
- [ ] Are tables easy to read without horizontal scrolling?
- [ ] Is the date, author, and version visible?
