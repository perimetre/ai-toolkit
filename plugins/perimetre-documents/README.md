# perimetre-documents

**Version:** 1.0.0 — Last updated: 2026-02-18

Plugin for professional document writing at Périmètre. Covers structure, clarity, tone, and formatting for reports, proposals, and presentations.

## Audience

Anyone on the Périmètre team writing professional documents — project managers, developers writing specs, or non-technical team members producing client-facing deliverables.

Pairs well with `perimetre-brand-guidelines` for on-brand output (colours, typography, logo usage). This plugin handles structure and writing principles; brand-guidelines handles visual identity.

## Skills

| Skill | What it covers |
|-------|----------------|
| `document` | Leading with the conclusion, one-idea-per-section discipline, heading hierarchy, table and list usage, concise prose, avoiding jargon, client-facing tone, and executive summary structure |

## Commands

This plugin has no commands — the `document` skill activates automatically when Claude writes or reviews a document, or you can invoke it explicitly:

> "Using the document skill, write a project proposal for the client."
