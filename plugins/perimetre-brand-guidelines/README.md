# perimetre-brand-guidelines

**Version:** 1.0.0 — Last updated: 2026-02-18

Loads Périmètre's visual identity into Claude's context — colours, typography, and logo usage — so every deliverable looks and feels on-brand.

## Audience

Anyone producing deliverables that carry the Périmètre name: developers, designers, writers, and project managers. Lightweight and broadly useful — install it alongside any other plugin for on-brand output.

Pairs especially well with:
- `perimetre-documents` — brand-aware document writing
- `perimetre-apps` — on-brand UI and component work

## Skills

| Skill | What it covers |
|-------|----------------|
| `brand-guidelines` | Colour palette (Carbon, Steel, Aqua), Satoshi typeface rules, logo usage and restrictions, application guidelines for documents and presentations, tone of voice principles |

**Colour quick reference:**

| Name | HEX | Role |
|------|-----|------|
| Carbon | `#111111` | Primary text, dark backgrounds |
| Steel | `#737678` | Secondary text, borders, captions |
| Aqua | `#13FADC` | Accent, highlights, CTAs |

## Commands

This plugin has no commands — the `brand-guidelines` skill activates automatically when Claude produces brand-related content, or you can invoke it explicitly by mentioning it in your request:

> "Using the brand-guidelines skill, write an email to a client about the project update."
