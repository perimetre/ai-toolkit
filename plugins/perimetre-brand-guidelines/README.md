# perimetre-brand-guidelines

**Version:** 1.0.0 — Last updated: 2026-02-18

A plugin for keeping Claude aligned with Périmètre's visual identity. It loads the brand guidelines — colours, typography, and logo usage — directly into context so that any deliverable Claude produces is consistent and on-brand.

## Skills

### `brand-guidelines`

Loads Périmètre's full brand identity into Claude's context for the session.

**Use it when:**
- Creating a document, presentation, or PDF that represents Périmètre
- Writing external communications (emails, proposals, reports)
- Producing any visual or written content that carries the Périmètre name

**What it covers:**
- Colour palette: Carbon (`#111111`), Steel (`#737678`), Aqua (`#13FADC`)
- Typography: Satoshi typeface, weight scale, hierarchy rules
- Logo usage: approved colour combinations, minimum sizes, what to avoid
- Application rules for documents, presentations, and emails
- Tone of voice principles
